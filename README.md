# mileage_analysis
analysis of data from @automatic and others sources

I removed the data/ directory, but the trips data come from a standard data dump from the [Automatic](http://www.automatic.com) site. The mileage data comes from data I collected at each fill-up with a timestamp, odometer reading, total gallons purchased and total price paid.
